    "1. First of all we declare a Common Table Expression ('events') in which we have 3 different columns:\n",
    "    - 'device_id' = Unique identification of users.\n",
    "    - 'time_stamp' = Specific time in which an event happens.\n",
    "    - 'next_time_stamp' = Here we get the next time stamp depending on the user and ordered by time stamp.\n",
    "    - This table selects the information from 'events_table'. It only asks for just one type of event (event_id = 4) that happened during August of 2019 (month = '201908'), in just 1 of the Clients (app_id = 1). \n",
    "2. We declare a second Common Table Expression ('per_event') in which we have 2 columns:\n",
    "    - 'device_id'\n",
    "    - 'time_diff' = Here we get the difference (in seconds) between 'time_stamp' and 'next_time_stamp'.\n",
    "    - This table selects its information from our previous table 'events'. It has no clauses.\n",
    "3. Finally we have our SELECT:\n",
    "    - 'device_id'\n",
    "    - 'avg_per_user' = Here we get the average time difference (difference between time stamps) of every user.\n",
    "    - This table selects all its information from 'per_event'. The 'GROUP BY 1' groups the AVG(time_diff) by our first column, that in this case is 'device_id'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### To sum up, this query generates a two column table ('device_id' and 'avg_per_user') in which we have the average time difference every unique user of a certain app (1) took to do the same event (4) during August of 2019."

    "A way in which this Query could be used as a trigger in the business side is, for example, if we take 'Opening the App' as it was the 'event_id', we could start to notice when a certain user or group of users is becoming inactive.<br>\n",
    "This way, we can start to make some specific bidding for those clients in order to get them to use the app more frequently."
